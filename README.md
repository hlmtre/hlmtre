### I am a tiny part of the universe experiencing itself.

I am currently the network administrator for Northern Valley Indian Health, a series of healthcare clinics in Northern California. I do a lot of networking, but also manage all of our Linux infrastructure, using saltstack for automation.
In my spare time (which is a rarity with a tiny human), I play guitar and competitive FPSes with old friends. We are not very good. Occasionally I have the brain energy to program, making my own little projects and sometimes contributing to existing open source projects.

I live in Chico with my wife and tiny human and three cats.

### Projects
- **[pybot][pybot-github]** ([@hlmtre/pybot][pybot-github]) A python IRC bot I started all the way back in 2012, to learn python and the IRC protocol. Development has slowed but believe it or not still happens.
- **[homemaker][homemaker-crates]** ([@hlmtre/homemaker][homemaker-github]) Slightly more than yet another dotfile manager, written in Rust.
